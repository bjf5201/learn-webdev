# learn-webdev
A collection of web development resources that I will update and organize as I gather them over time.

There are many articles and websites out there covering how one can go about learning web development from scratch. However, I often find myself overwhelmed with where to begin and what routes to take. As I continue this project, I hope to create pathways to guide new developers on their journey to learning web development. Of course, there are many paid programs where one can find guided course material, but finding all the information you need in one place for free is often difficult. I know that if I had had a guide or a repo of resources it would have saved me lots of time Googling and trying to decide what to learn next.
